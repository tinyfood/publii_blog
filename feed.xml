                <p>TinyFood.org strives to educate while improving access to high quality food. Our approach is to support the development of food hubs. Our goals are basic... to make it possible for low income families to afford predominantly organic, locally sourced sustainable foods.</p>
<p>We believe that high quality food is a human right,  Science has show us that consumption of high quality food prevents disease, increases congitive and metabolic functions, and speeds up the healing process.  Food connects us to our cultural, economic and environmental sustainability, and effects our community, family, and personal wellbeing.  By networking common needs, and enabling small groups to privately control their own food hub ordering systems, we aim to see huge benefit and transformation in these areas. of our lives and society.</p>
